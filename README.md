## Purpose of Our Project

We were working with a stakeholder, Kala’i Ellis, a Spatial Data Analyst at the Spatial Analysis Laboratory (SAL) at Smith College. For the project, we set out to produce a system that could organize a large number of files and was relatively easy to keep updated. Drone use has been rising for use in projects at Smith. Each month, 10-20 separate drone flights occur, with each having individual folders with images and metadata that are stored by month and specific date. Some files can be shared and utilized across multiple projects. The files from these drone flights are currently being stored in Google Drive. However, it was difficult to recall past data, and it was very time intensive to find information for new projects from existing folders. We created a searchable database that is linked to the Google Drive data from the SAL and can be updated monthly. Using our database and an accompanying front-end tool, you can filter projects by date and type, making this database is easier to parse through and more accessible for members other than Kala’i in the lab.
